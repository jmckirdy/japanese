# ⛩️ Easy Japanese Hiragana and Katakana Charts ⛩️

✨ This is just a 2 page site, to view it, download the files and open index.html.

<p>👹 These charts are unique because unlike most kana(writing) charts, this one is laid out left-to-right, so that it is easier on the Anglephone mind. Only the basics are displayed, and it's color coded/highlighted.</p>

<p>✈️ It's meant to be a resource for people learning the Japanese writing systems of Hiragana, and Katakana.</p>
