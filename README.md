Easy Japanese Hiragana and Katakana Charts for English Speakers

This is just a 2 page site, to view download files and open index.html.

Unlike most Kana (writing) charts, this one is laid out left-to-right, so that it is easier on the Anglephone mind. Only the basics are displayed, and it is color highlighted. This is meant to be a resource for people learning the Japanese writing systems of Hiragana, and Katakana.
